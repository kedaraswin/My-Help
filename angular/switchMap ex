Let's say you have an e-commerce website where users can search for products. When a user types in a search query, you want to fetch the results from the API and display them to the user. However, if the user types in a new search query before the previous one has finished, you want to cancel the previous API request and make a new request with the latest search query.
import { Component, OnInit } from '@angular/core';
import { Subject } from 'rxjs';
import { switchMap, debounceTime, distinctUntilChanged } from 'rxjs/operators';
import { ProductService } from './product.service';

@Component({
  selector: 'app-root',
  template: `
    <input type="text" (input)="search$.next($event.target.value)" placeholder="Search products">
    <div *ngFor="let product of products">
      {{ product.name }}
    </div>
  `
})
export class AppComponent implements OnInit {
  search$ = new Subject<string>();
  products = [];

  constructor(private productService: ProductService) {}

  ngOnInit() {
    this.search$
      .pipe(
        debounceTime(300),
        distinctUntilChanged(),
        switchMap(searchTerm => this.productService.searchProducts(searchTerm))
      )
      .subscribe(products => {
        this.products = products;
      });
  }
}

Here's a business use case example for the switchMap operator in RxJS.

Let's say you have an e-commerce website where users can search for products. When a user types in a search query, you want to fetch the results from the API and display them to the user. However, if the user types in a new search query before the previous one has finished, you want to cancel the previous API request and make a new request with the latest search query.

Here's how you could implement this behavior with the switchMap operator:

typescript
Copy code
import { Component, OnInit } from '@angular/core';
import { Subject } from 'rxjs';
import { switchMap, debounceTime, distinctUntilChanged } from 'rxjs/operators';
import { ProductService } from './product.service';

@Component({
  selector: 'app-root',
  template: `
    <input type="text" (input)="search$.next($event.target.value)" placeholder="Search products">
    <div *ngFor="let product of products">
      {{ product.name }}
    </div>
  `
})
export class AppComponent implements OnInit {
  search$ = new Subject<string>();
  products = [];

  constructor(private productService: ProductService) {}

  ngOnInit() {
    this.search$
      .pipe(
        debounceTime(300),
        distinctUntilChanged(),
        switchMap(searchTerm => this.productService.searchProducts(searchTerm))
      )
      .subscribe(products => {
        this.products = products;
      });
  }
}
In this example, a Subject named search$ is used to capture the search query from the input field. The search$ subject is then piped through a number of operators:

debounceTime: This operator delays emitting values for a specified amount of time. In this case, it delays emitting values for 300 milliseconds to prevent making API requests for every keystroke.
distinctUntilChanged: This operator only emits values if they are different from the previous value. This is useful to avoid making API requests for the same search query.
switchMap: This operator maps the values from the search$ subject to API requests made with the ProductService. It also cancels any previous API requests that haven't completed when a new value is emitted from the search$ subject.
